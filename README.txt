An attempt to train a neural network to play Tic Tac Toe.
Overview

This project aimed to build a simple neural network from scratch that could learn to play Tic Tac Toe through training. The goal was for the network to eventually play competent or unbeatable games.
Outcome

The network failed to learn an effective strategy. Training never converged on useful behavior, and the model continued to make poor or random moves.
What Was Tried

    Self-play training

    Basic reward signals (win/loss/tie)

    Multiple network sizes and activations

Despite these, the network did not improve meaningfully.
Notes

The code remains as a reference for experimenting with custom neural networks and training loops. It may be a helpful starting point or cautionary example.

Let me know if you want to include code structure, install instructions, or future plans.
